## üìÑ Project Description
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shaping the future of education through three Python-based mini-projects:
1. **Early Risk Prediction** ‚Äî Uses Logistic Regression to identify students who may be at academic risk.
2. **Content-Based Recommender** ‚Äî Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend learning resources.
3. **Short-Answer Grading Helper** ‚Äî Uses TF-IDF and rubric keywords to assist teachers in grading.

## üìÅ Repository Contents
- **AI_in_Education_Project_Report.pdf** ‚Äî Full project report with methodology, results, and discussion.
- **ai_in_education_demos.py** ‚Äî Python script containing all three mini-projects.
- **requirements.txt** ‚Äî Python dependencies for running the code.

## ‚ñ∂ How to Run the Code
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run any of the demos:
```bash
# Early Risk Prediction
python PYTHON CODING.py --demo risk --save-plots

# Content-Based Recommender
python PYTHON CODING.py --demo recommender --topn 5

# Short-Answer Grading Helper
python PYTHON CODING.py --demo grading
```
