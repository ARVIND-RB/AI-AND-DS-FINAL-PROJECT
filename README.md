# The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Shaping the Future of Education

**Name:** Arvind R B  
**Email:** soundaryaabala@gmail.com  

## 📄 Project Description
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shaping the future of education through three Python-based mini-projects:
1. **Early Risk Prediction** — Uses Logistic Regression to identify students who may be at academic risk.
2. **Content-Based Recommender** — Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend learning resources.
3. **Short-Answer Grading Helper** — Uses TF-IDF and rubric keywords to assist teachers in grading.

## 📁 Repository Contents
- **AI_in_Education_Project_Report.pdf** — Full project report with methodology, results, and discussion.
- **ai_in_education_demos.py** — Python script containing all three mini-projects.
- **requirements.txt** — Python dependencies for running the code.

## ▶ How to Run the Code
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run any of the demos:
```bash
# Early Risk Prediction
python ai_in_education_demos.py --demo risk --save-plots

# Content-Based Recommender
python ai_in_education_demos.py --demo recommender --topn 5

# Short-Answer Grading Helper
python ai_in_education_demos.py --demo grading
```

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- ReportLab (for generating PDFs, if needed)
